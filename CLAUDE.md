# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Start

```bash
make dev          # Install with dev dependencies (pytest/ruff)
make run          # Start server on port 8532
make test         # Run all tests
make testv        # Run tests with verbose output
```

**Bookmarklet flow:** Visit `/js/mirror-links.js` in browser, drag link to bookmarks bar, use on any page to capture clipboard data.

## Workflow Preferences

### Implementation Plans

**Always create an implementation plan before making changes if one does not exist.**

For any non-trivial task, create a plan using any available mechanism (`TaskCreate`, `superpowers:writing-plans` skill, `superpowers:feature-dev` skill, or manual planning). Then:

1. Mark plan items as `in_progress` when starting work on them
2. Mark plan items as `completed` when finished
3. Create corresponding git commits to track progress

**Commit linkage:** Each git commit message should reference the plan item it completes (e.g., "feat: add error handling for edge cases - completes plan item #3").

This ensures:
- Clear visibility into what was done and what's remaining
- Git history that maps directly to the implementation plan
- Easy to resume work if interrupted

### Coding Guidelines

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

#### 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple valid approaches exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

#### 2. Simplicity First

Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

#### 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

#### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform vague tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria enable independent progress. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

#### 5. Testable Code

Write code that can be tested without external dependencies.

- **Isolate side effects** — I/O, network calls, and external services should be behind interfaces that can be mocked or stubbed.
- **Avoid global state** — Functions should receive dependencies as parameters, not reach for globals.
- **Prefer pure functions** — Given the same inputs, always return the same outputs with no side effects. Easiest to test.
- **Don't test through the database** — Business logic shouldn't require a running database to verify.
- **Constructor injection over service locators** — Explicit dependencies are clearer and easier to fake.

**The test:** Can you run the test suite offline? If not, the code is too coupled.

#### 6. Stay Focused

Keep work narrowly scoped to the current task. Resist the urge to improve adjacent code.

- **Don't simplify existing code** just because you notice it could be shorter or clearer.
- **Don't refactor** unless it's directly required to implement the requested change.
- **Don't improve** variable names, comments, or formatting in code you aren't otherwise touching.
- **If you discover issues** — bugs, security holes, or needed improvements — surface them to the user immediately, then ask:
  - Address now?
  - Add to ISSUES.md for later?
  - Ignore for now?
- **ISSUES.md discipline:** Capture issues discovered during a session that are not directly related to the current task. Adding them to `ISSUES.md` keeps work focused and prevents scope creep. Include the date, session context, and any workarounds. Resist the urge to fix unrelated issues "while you're here."
- **Don't fix pre-existing bugs** you encounter unless the user explicitly says yes.

**The test:** After completing the task, only the lines directly related to the request should have changed. If you "couldn't help but notice" something and fixed it, you went too far.

### Pull Request Discipline

**Never create a pull request without asking the user first.**

- Do not run `gh pr create` or equivalent commands unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not push branches to remote without confirmation.
- When work is complete, present a summary and ask: "Ready to create a PR?" or "Shall I push this branch?"
- Wait for explicit user approval before creating PRs, pushing branches, or opening GitHub/Merge requests.

This prevents surprise PRs and ensures the user controls when and how their work is shared.

#### 7. Test Documentation

When writing tests, always add a comment describing what the test does and why it is important.

- **Describe the behavior being tested** — What specific scenario or edge case does this cover?
- **Explain the importance** — Why does this test matter? What would break if this behavior changed?
- **Keep it concise** — One or two sentences is usually sufficient.
- **Update comments when tests change** — Ensure the description stays accurate.

**The test:** Can someone reading the test file understand the intent without reading the implementation?

## Development Commands

### Setup & Running
- **Install dependencies**: `make install`
- **Run application**: `make run` (starts the web-tool locally via `uv run python web-tool.py`)
- **Development dependencies**: `make dev`

### Quality & Testing
- **Lint code**: `make lint`
- **Format code**: `make format`
- **All quality checks**: `make check` (lint + format + import sorting)
- **Run all tests**: `make test`
- **Run tests with coverage**: `make testcov`
- **Run tests with verbose output**: `make testv`
- **Run a specific test file**: `uv run pytest tests/test_filename.py -v`
- **Run a specific test class**: `uv run pytest tests/test_filename.py::TestClassName -v`

### Docker
- **Run published image**: `make docker-run`
- **Build image**: `make docker-build`
- **Build multi-platform**: `make docker-buildx`
- **Push to registry**: `make docker-push` (requires DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/TOKEN env vars)
- **Full release**: `make docker-release` (build and push with version tag)
- **Stop container**: `make docker-stop`
- **Clean build cache**: `make docker-clean` (stop container and prune buildx cache)

**Docker Release Patterns:**
- **Version from git tag**: Use `VERSION =` (lazy, not `:=`) to avoid running git on non-docker targets; include `dev` fallback for non-git contexts
- **Shell pipeline gotcha**: `cmd | sed ... || fallback` won't trigger fallback on first command failure because pipelines return the last command's exit code; use variable storage first: `var=$$(cmd) && echo "$$var" | sed ... || fallback`
- **Docker Hub description**: Updated manually via the Docker Hub UI after `make docker-release`
- **Terminal reminder**: `make docker-release` displays a boxed reminder with manual update steps after a successful push
- **Two tagging workflows**: (1) Local: `git tag && git push && make docker-release`; (2) GitHub Releases: create via UI → `git fetch origin --tags` → `git checkout` → `make docker-release`
- **sed macOS compatibility**: Basic `sed 's/pattern/replacement/'` works on both GNU and BSD sed; only `sed -i` (in-place editing) requires macOS-specific handling
- **Worktree file sync**: If changes exist in the main worktree before creating a new worktree, either stash them first or run `git checkout <branch> -- <file>` in the worktree to get the correct version before editing

### Container Run Scripts
- **Scripts:** `scripts/run-web-tool-docker.sh`, `scripts/run-web-tool-container.sh` (Apple `container`), `scripts/web-tool-autostart.sh {install|uninstall|status}` (launchd agent `com.dockmann.web-tool`); guide at `docs/running-on-macos.md`
- **Apple runtime detection:** it leaves no Docker markers (`/.dockerenv`, cgroup names), so pass `-e CONTAINER_RUNTIME=...` or the app binds dev port 8535 in debug mode and ignores `/data`
- **Apple port publishing:** `container run -p HOST:CONTAINER` binds `0.0.0.0`; use `127.0.0.1:HOST:CONTAINER` for loopback-only
- **Autostart bakes the checkout path:** the plist points at the run script in the checkout it was installed from; switching to a branch without `scripts/` makes launchd retry every 30s — run `uninstall` first
- **Verify a live container:** `container ls -a`, `container logs web-tool`, `lsof -nP -iTCP:8532 -sTCP:LISTEN`, `tail ~/Library/Logs/web-tool.log`
- **Shell script checks:** `shellcheck scripts/*.sh` and `/bin/bash -n` (macOS ships bash 3.2 — no bash 4 features)

### Git Workflow

#### Branch Verification Check
- **Always verify branch before committing** — run `git branch --show-current` after subagent work completes
- **Subagents may not respect branch rules** — the parent session must enforce branch discipline
- **If on main/master/develop/trunk after subagent work**: stop and create feature branch before proceeding

- **Delete merged branch**: `git branch -d <branch>` (safe delete; use `-D` to force delete unmerged)
- **Feature branches**: Never commit directly to `main`/`master` — always create feature branch first
- **Style hygiene**: Move inline styles to CSS classes; use existing design tokens before creating new ones
- **Worktrees:** Always create worktrees in `.worktrees/<branch>` directory in the repo root. Use: `git worktree add .worktrees/<branch> -b <branch>`. Always run `make dev` and `make test` in the worktree before dispatching subagents. Verify with `git worktree list` to confirm active worktrees.

## Python Runtime
- **Use `uv run`** for all commands — `pyproject.toml` requires Python 3.14 only (`>=3.14,<3.15`). Using a pyenv-managed Python will fail to find test dependencies.
- **Dev deps required:** Run `make dev` before `make test` or `uv run python -m pytest` — pytest/ruff are dev dependencies, not installed by `make install`
- **Native prerequisites:** CairoSVG needs the Cairo library (`brew install cairo` on macOS); `make dev`/`make install` download the NLTK `wordnet` and `words` corpora via `make nltk-data`

## Python Version Upgrades
- **Hard cutover:** Update `requires-python`, ruff `target-version`, Dockerfile base image, `.python-version`, and docs together
- **PEP 649:** Python 3.14+ supports unquoted forward references; ruff `py314` target flags quoted annotations as unnecessary

## Type Annotations
- Use `Type | None` for optional/nullable fields (e.g., `parent: SoupElem | None` when None is passed)
- Unquote forward references when upgrading to Python 3.14+ (PEP 649 deferred evaluation)

## Module Packaging
- **New Python packages:** When adding new packages (e.g., `routes/`), update both `Dockerfile` (COPY command) and `pyproject.toml` (`packages` list in `[tool.setuptools]`)

## Template Security
- **XSS prevention:** Use `|e` filter for HTML context, `|tojson` filter for JavaScript context when rendering user-controlled data in templates

## CSS Design System
- **Tokens:** Use CSS custom properties (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--font-size-*`) from `static/mirror.css`
- **Fluid widths:** Use `width: clamp(min, preferred%, max)` instead of media queries for responsive containers
- **Components:** Prefer semantic classes (`.panel`, `.variant-row`, `.btn-copy`) over inline styles
- **Tooltip positioning:** Add `window.scrollX/Y` to `getBoundingClientRect()` coords for accurate placement
- **Long metadata strings:** Add `word-wrap: break-word` to any text container that may hold long unbreakable strings (cookie strings, base64, URLs)
- **CSS :has() for radio sibling states:** When a radio is a sibling of an element you want to style based on checked state, `:has()` must target the common ancestor. E.g., `.variant-row:has(input[name="fragment_variant"]:checked)` not `.fragment-text-label:has(input...)` since the radio and label are siblings.

## Shared JavaScript
- **tooltip.js:** Shared `showTooltip()` and `attachCopyListeners()` functions — import in templates with `<script src="/static/js/tooltip.js">`
- **Paste handlers:** Use `document.body.querySelector()` for tooltip cleanup (tooltips appended to body, not trigger element)

## URL Parsing
- **Schemeless URLs:** `urlparse()` treats schemeless inputs as paths; handle by reparsing with `//` prefix when `netloc` is empty and scheme is missing

## PR Review Comments
- **Check before addressing:** When asked to address PR comments, first run `gh pr view <num> --json state,headRefName` to verify the PR isn't merged or the branch doesn't already contain the fixes
- **View all PR details:** `gh pr view <num> --json body,comments --jq '.'` shows body + all comments in one command
- **View Copilot comments:** `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<num>/comments` — addresses these before merge

## Documentation
- Keep CONTRIBUTING.md dependency versions in sync with pyproject.toml constraints
- **README links:** `README.md` is rendered at `/` by the app and pasted into Docker Hub, where repo-relative links 404 — use absolute `https://github.com/ohanaverse/web-tool/blob/main/...` URLs for anything outside the image

## AI-Generated Planning Documents

**Attach to PR comments, don't commit.** Any specs, plans, task lists, or other planning documents generated by agents for a PR/worktree should never be committed:
1. Write planning docs to `docs/superpowers/plans/`, `docs/superpowers/specs/`, or similar local directories as untracked files
2. Attach files directly to the PR comment using GitHub's file attachment feature — this keeps docs alongside the PR for reviewer context without adding commit noise
3. Delete local untracked copies after the PR is merged or closed

**Design docs vs. PR docs:** Design specs go to `docs/superpowers/specs/` and get committed (they're part of feature development). PR planning docs (task lists, implementation notes) should be attached to PR comments, not committed.

## Testing
- **Tests:** `tests/test_*.py` (341 tests as of 2026-10) — unit tests for library modules in `library/`, integration tests for routes
- **Mocking Pillow images:** When mocking `Image.resize`, set `.resize.return_value = mock_img` so callers can chain `.width`/`.height` on the returned image
- **Unused variables:** Run `ruff check --select F841` before committing; unused assignments in tests often indicate incomplete assertions
- **Test pattern consistency:** When adding paired tests (e.g., ICO/SVG variants), match the existing test's structure exactly — don't assign `result` if sibling test doesn't use it
- **JS template testing:** Template rendering tests (`test_js_escaping.py`) verify JS variable names and structure in rendered output, but cannot catch runtime ReferenceErrors — use Playwright/browser testing for JS runtime bugs
- **Test runtime:** After `make dev`, tests run via `make test` (which uses `uv run pytest`). Dev dependencies (pytest, ruff) are available through the uv-managed virtual environment.

## Workflow
- **Brainstorming first:** Use `superpowers:brainstorming` before any implementation. Design must be approved before invoking writing-plans. Hard gate: no code until design approved.
- **Multi-step implementations:** Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` skill. Create tasks with `TaskCreate`, set dependencies, dispatch one `general-purpose` subagent per task.
- **Commit per step:** When implementing task lists or plans with multiple steps, commit and push after each step is completed. Mark steps done in the local plan file so commits in GitHub match execution progress. This ensures status is tracked locally and remotely, and work can be resumed if interrupted.
- **Code reviews:** Score issues 0-100 for confidence; only report issues ≥80 to minimize false positives

## Session Startup

**Prompt for worktree switch:** When a new session starts and a worktree exists from the previous session (check `git worktree list`), prompt the user: "Switch to worktree `<branch>` from last session?" Offer yes/no options.

## Known Tool Issues

**Ruff formatter bug:** `make format` incorrectly converts `except (A, B):` to `except A, B:` (Python 2 syntax). If `docker_util.py` ever needs a Ruff workaround, add it to `[tool.ruff.format].extend-exclude` in `pyproject.toml` so formatting skips that file without overriding Ruff's default excludes or disabling linting for it.

## Architecture & Project Structure

The `web-tool` is a utility for extracting and processing information from web pages, primarily interacting with the user via browser bookmarklets.

### High-Level Flow
1. **Client-Side**: Bookmarklets capture page data and copy it to the clipboard. Bookmarklet JS is served dynamically via `/js/<name>.js`.
2. **Server-Side**: A Flask application (`web-tool.py`) processes the captured data via various endpoints (e.g., `/clip-collector`, `/mirror-clip`).
3. **Processing**: The `library/` directory contains the core logic for HTML parsing, text extraction, and favicon management.

### Key Components
- **Core Application**: `web-tool.py` - The main entry point and Flask server. Registers blueprints from `routes/` (`mirror_links`, `mirror_favicons`, `javascript`, `debug`).
- **Logic Library**: `library/` — Core modules:
  - `util.py` (PageMetadata, MirrorData, TitleVariants, ClipCache)
  - `html_util.py` (favicon system, link parsing)
  - `text_util.py` (NLP extraction)
  - `text_format.py` (ascii_text, html_text, path_safe_filename)
  - `title_variants.py` (deduplicate_variants)
  - `url_util.py` (URL parsing, fetching)
  - `img_util.py` (ICO/SVG conversion)
  - `unicode_util.py` (category names)
  - `content_type.py` (MIME type detection)
  - `fragment_handlers.py` (anchor/heading fragment resolution)
  - `docker_util.py` (container detection via `/.dockerenv`, `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` env, cgroup names, hostname prefix, `uname` — selects port 8532 vs dev 8535 and the `/data` cache path)
- **Favicon System**: Implements a three-tier cache for favicons:
    1. `static/favicon-overrides.yml` (User Overrides - Highest priority)
    2. `static/favicon.yml` (App Defaults - Medium priority)
    3. `local-cache/favicon.yml` or `/data/favicon.yml` (Auto-discovered - Lowest priority)
- **Static Assets**: `static/` contains CSS and favicon YAML configs. Bookmarklet JS is served dynamically via `/js/<name>.js` from `mirror.js` in templates; only `inline-image.js` and `paste-favicon.js` live in `static/js/`.
- **Templates**: `templates/` — key templates: `mirror-links.html` (link generation), `mirror-favicons.html` (favicon management), `plain_text.html` (auto-copy wrapper), `clip-proxy.html` (container clipboard bridge)
- **Specs**: `specs/` contains 17 page specs and a parent spec. See `specs/web-tool-spec.md` for the full index.

### Specs Conventions
- Each web-tool page has a spec at `specs/pages/<name>.md` following the `mirror-links.md` format
- Parent spec at `specs/web-tool-spec.md` documents shared patterns (clipboard flow, favicon cache, `plain_text_response`)
- When modifying a page: update its spec first. When adding a page: create its spec first
- **Any change that conflicts with or contradicts an existing spec must be explicitly approved by the user before proceeding**
- **Spec template:** Copy `specs/pages/mirror-links.md` when creating new page specs

### Known Bug Patterns
- `buildWikiLink`/`buildSimpleLink` in `mirror-links.html` require `escapeHtml(url)` — URLs are inserted into innerHTML and must be escaped
- `buildHtmlLink` uses `favH`/`favW` (the local const aliases, not the outer parameter names)
- Template domain extraction must use backend-computed `override_domain`/`override_path_scope` — string-splitting on `/` reverses the TLD
- Walrus operator precedence: `(t := resp.get_type()) != "image/svg"` — parentheses required around walrus assignment before comparison
- **Dynamic radio buttons:** `querySelectorAll` at `DOMContentLoaded` misses elements added later. Use event delegation on a parent container that exists at load time (e.g., `#favicon-options`) for dynamically added radio/checkbox groups
- **Radio + input in label:** When embedding an input inside a `<label>` linked to a radio, use `for`/`id` linking (not nesting) to prevent clicking the input from toggling the radio off
- **Fragment Text row:** Always includes: radio + Copy button + "Fragment Text" label + (read-only span OR editable input). CSS `:has()` on `.variant-row` shows/hides read-only vs. editable based on radio checked state.

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.14, Flask
- **HTML Parsing**: BeautifulSoup4, lxml
- **Image/SVG Processing**: CairoSVG, Pillow, Magika, PyMuPDF
- **Text Processing**: NLTK, anyascii
- **JS Processing**: jsmin, esprima (bookmarklet minification and parsing)
- **URL Handling**: urllib.parse (URL parsing), requests (HTTP fetching)
- **Package Management**: `uv`
- **Linting/Formatting**: Ruff
- **Testing**: coverage.py (via `make testcov`)
